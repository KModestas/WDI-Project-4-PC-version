# WDI Project 4
<h2>What is Euphoria?</h2>

<p>For my Final Project, I built an app that retrieves all of live music around London and displays it to the User; allowing them to track all of the concerts they are interested in. The inspiration for this app came from the fact that I love to go to music festivals with my friends, so creating a music based app that I could use in real life seemed like a no brainer.

<h2>How to Use</h2>

Once a user registers and logs in to their account. They will be greeted by this Gigs Index page

From here, the user can sift through gigs in London and can filter those gigs by their name as well as sort them by parameters such as date and alphabetical order.

Once a user has found the gig they want to track, they can click on the gig which will bring them to its 'show' page. Here, details such as price and description are displayed as well as a google map of it's precise location.

A user can thereon click the track button, which will redirect them to their profile page, displaying all of their 'tracked' gigs in the order of the most imminent ones first. To untrack the gig, a user can simply click on the 'untrack' button on the gigs show page.

<h2>Wins</h2>


Overall, I enjoyed working with React as it seems to be much more simple and efficient than AngularJS from my experience. After the course finished, I also really enjoyed being able to sit down in my own time and continue working on the application. I was able to go over my app and understand react more throughly. I also particularly enjoyed working on the styling and felt like I was able to captivate the theme of a concert in my app.


<h2>Challenges</h2>
Other than building something relatively complicated with a week’s worth of React experience, the main challenge for me was the mental hurdle of pushing through the last project after an intense three months of non stop action. Additionally, although I intended to use React Bootstrap, I ended up using the original Bootstrap by adding classes to my components because I felt it was slightly more intuitive.


<h2>Future improvements</h2>

Although I have already implemented some post course features such as filtering and sorting and the google maps API, I think that if I wanted to expand my app further, I could make it global. What I mean by this, is allowing users to filter gigs from any location in the world by typing a place in an input bar and retrieving the gigs from the local area specified.
